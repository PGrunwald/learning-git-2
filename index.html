  <h1>I want it that way</h1>
  <p>
    Yeah
    You are my fire<br>
    The one desire<br>
    Believe when I say<br>
    I want it that way <br>
    But we are two worlds apart<br>
    Can't reach to your heart<br>
    When you say<br>
    That I want it that way <br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a heartache<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a mistake<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    I never wanna hear you say<br>
    I want it that way<br>
    Am I your fire?<br>
    Your one desire<br>
    Yes, I know it's too late<br>
    But I want it that way<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a heartache<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a mistake<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    I never wanna hear you say<br>
    I want it that way<br>
    Now I can see that we've fallen apart<br>
    From the way that it used to be, yeah<br>
    No matter the distance<br>
    I want you to know<br>
    That deep down inside of me<br>
    You are my fire<br>
    The one desire<br>
    You are (you are, you are, you are)<br>
    Don't wanna hear you say<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a heartache<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)<br>
    I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)<br>
    I want it that way<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a heartache<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothing but a mistake<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    I never want to hear you say (never wanna hear you say)<br>
    I want it that way<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a heartache<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a mistake<br>
    Tell me why<br>
    I never want to hear you say (don't want to hear you say)
    I want it that way<br>
